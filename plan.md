# Plan: Streamlit to React + FastAPI PRD

## Notes
- User requests a comprehensive Product Requirement Document (PRD) for migrating an existing Streamlit project to a React (with Material UI) frontend and FastAPI backend.
- The PRD must ensure pixel-perfect UI and identical backend/LLM/multi-agent logic.
- The PRD should be detailed, with clear sections, bullet points, and code snippets.
- No changes should be made to existing LLM/multi-agent workflows.
- Recommendations for performance and maintainability are encouraged.

## Task List
- [x] Gather requirements and clarify PRD structure
- [x] Draft Project Overview section
- [x] Map Streamlit UI to React + Material UI components
- [x] Outline FastAPI backend architecture

- [x] List technology stack for frontend and backend
- [x] Recommend folder structure for both projects
- [x] Provide installation and setup steps
- [x] Write migration plan and validation steps
- [ ] Review and refine PRD for completeness and clarity

## Current Goal
Review and refine the PRD for completeness
